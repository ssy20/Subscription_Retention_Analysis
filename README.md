# Subscription_Retention_Analysis

Given demographic information about subscribers and the time at which they unsubscribed, build a model to predict the user retention rate. Based on the prediction, estimate the customer LTV and identity the best price point for subscription programs in different countries and from different marketing channel. 

# Data 
- user_id : the id of the user
- subscription_signup_date : when the user signed up for the subscription
- subscription_monthly_cost : the cost of monthly subscription ($29/$49/$99)
- source : marketing acquisition channel (SEO/Ads/Friend Referral)
- billing_cycles : the number billing cycles 
- is_active : whether the subscription is still active (1) or not (0)
# Result 
Within one year, the users who sign up for the $99 subscription program generate the most revenue. However, the users who sign up for the $29 subscription program have the highest retention rate after one year. The $49 subscription program has largest user base in all countries.

In terms of retention rate, both friend referral program and SEO are doing much better than Ads. However, most users are brought by Ads.
